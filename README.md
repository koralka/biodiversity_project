# Biodiversity Data Analysis
The goal of this project was to analyse data from the National Park Service to identify trends in endangered species across various parks.  

I initially had a plan for the analysis. However, as I explored the data, I kept finding inconsistencies in the dataset and continuously refined my approach. After experimenting with different methods and reading interesting posts about this specific dataset, I allowed myself to 'go with the flow' and see what the data would reveal.  

I tried my best to keep the project as organised as possible, despite the evolving approach.  

# Files
- **observations.csv**: Contains observation data for species across parks.  
- **species.csv**: Contains species information including conservation status.

## Approach  
As mentioned, I allowed myself to experiment rather than following a strict plan. Therefore, this project can be viewed as a walkthrough of discovering and analysing the data, where the process evolved based on what I encountered.  

## Data Cleaning 
The data had duplicate and triplicate entries due to multiple observations of the same species in the same park. This caused several challenges. I spent a considerable amount of time researching and trying to find the best approach to handle these duplicates. I kept some of my initial methods to highlight how one step (in this case, dealing with duplicates) can impact the analysis.  

## Exploration and Analysis 
**Visualisation techniques** were a major part of this project. In addition, I explored various data distributions and conducted statistical significance tests to understand the relationship between species, their conservation status, and observation data.  

## Conclusion
This project explores the distribution of species across national parks, the impact of duplicate observations, and provides insights into the conservation status of various species.
